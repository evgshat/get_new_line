onald's Corporation is an American fast food company,
founded in 1940 as a restaurant operated by Richard and Maurice McDonald,
 in San Bernardino, California, United States. They rechristened their
  business as a hamburger stand, and later turned the company into
   a franchise, with the Golden Arches logo being introduced in 1953 at a
location in Phoenix, Arizona. In 1955, Ray Kroc, a businessman, joined the company
as a franchise agent and proceeded to purchase the chain from the McDonald brothers.

but moved its global headquarters to Chicago in June 2018.[6][7][8][9]ยง
